# DeploySentinel Cypress Recorder Plugin

Create Cypress tests scripts within the Cypress test browser by simply
interacting with your application, similar to the previous
[Cypress Studio](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/cypress-studio)
functionality previously available in Cypress v9. This plugin will allow you to
translate clicks, inputs, and other events into a Cypress script.

Built on top of the
[DeploySentinel Recorder Browser Extension](https://www.deploysentinel.com/recorder).

**Plugin only works for Cypress v10, not with v9 and below, currently compatible
with Chrome and Firefox**

## Get Started

### Install the plugin

```
npm install -D @deploysentinel/cypress-recorder
```

OR

```
yarn add --dev @deploysentinel/cypress-recorder
```

### Add Plugin to Cypress Config

Add the plugin to your `cypress.config.js` file:

```js
const { defineConfig } = require("cypress");

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      // Add plugin import here üëá
      require("@deploysentinel/cypress-recorder")(on, config);
    },
  },
});
```

### Use the Recorder

Run Cypress in `open` mode, select a spec to run, and then click "Record" button
on the top left of the test application panel to start recording.
